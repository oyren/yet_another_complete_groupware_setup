= Complete Private Server Setup for E-Mail, Cloud and more
 
Here I describe my server setup, which provides the following services:

* E-Mail (https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/[Mailcow])
* Cloud (https://www.seafile.com/en/home/[Seafile])
* Dynamic DNS (https://github.com/dprandzioch/docker-ddns[dprandzioch/docker-ddns @ Github])
* OpenVPN (https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn[kylemanna/docker-openvpn @ Github])
* A simple HTML Webpage

This Setup is set behind http://www.haproxy.org/[HAProxy] and https://letsencrypt.org/[LetsEncrypt]. And is deployed with https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker-Compose], to keep it as simple as possible.

I'm not a professional administrator and I run this setup privately only.

This is not supposed to be a copy&paste tutorial, but will probably work as such as well.
